# Circuit Helpers
A few short command line programs to help with simplifying basic RLC circuits, initially created while in basic circuit analysis courses.<br>
(also a repo for experimenting)<br>
<br>
Makefile-generated Executables:<br>
Equivalence - Calculate the equivalent of a resistive, inductive, capacitive, or phasor network.<br>
ComplexOperations - Perform basic operations on two complex numbers (using a custom complex class).<br>
Delta_WyeCalculator - Perform delta-wye circuit conversion.<br>
<br>
Other Files:<br>
Complex.cpp/Complex.h - Header and cpp file for a custom complex class
