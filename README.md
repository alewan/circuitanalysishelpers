Very basic code (in C/C++) to help with simplifying circuits (and a repo for testing with github).

C Files:
EquivalenceCalculator.c - A C program to find an equivalent of an R, L, or C network.

C++ Files:
ComplexOperations.cpp - A program to perform basic operations on two complex numbers (without the standard complex class).
delta_wyecalculator.cpp - A program to do the delta-wye circuit conversion.
Equivalence.cpp - A program to find the equivalent of an R, L, C, or phasor network.
Complex.cpp/Complex.h - Header and cpp file for a custom complex class
